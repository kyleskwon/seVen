<h1>seVen</h1>

<p>seVen is an self destructing to-do list that uses the Firebase API and AngularJS. Tasks are created with an expiration date of 7 days. If a task is not completed in one week, its not important enough.</p>

<p>Typically, to-do lists can get out of hand very quickly. To solve this problem, seVen manages your tasks automatically by separating them into active, complete and expired lists. Tasks are defined by their description. Also, they can be labeled as high, medium or low priority.</p>
