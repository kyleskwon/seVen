<h1>seVen</h1>
<hr>
<p>seVen is an self destructing to-do list that uses the Firebase API and AngularJS. Tasks are created with an expiration date of 7 days.</p>

<p>The idea is that if a task is not important enough to be finished in one week, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.</p>


<p>Typically, to-do lists can get out of hand very quickly. To solve this problem, seVen manages your tasks automatically by separating them into active, complete and expired lists.</p>


<p>Tasks are defined by their description. Also, they can be labeled as high, medium or low priority.</p>
